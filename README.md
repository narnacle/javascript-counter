# JavaScript Click Counter

This is a simple JavaScript project that demonstrates how to create a click counter. Every time the button is clicked, the counter value increments by 1 and updates on the screen. This project is great for beginners to understand basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: JavaScript
- **HTML**: Basic structure with an `<h2>` tag to display the counter and a button to increment it.
- **JavaScript Features**: 
  - Initializes a counter.
  - Uses a button click event to increment and display the updated counter.
  
## Features

- Simple button to increment the counter.
- Real-time display of counter value.
- Minimal and easy-to-follow code structure.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** or **download the files** to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/javascript-click-counter.git
    ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in any web browser to see the counter in action.

## Code Explanation

- **HTML**: Displays a counter initialized at 0, and a button that calls a JavaScript function.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Initializes a variable `count` to store the current counter value.
  - Defines `incrementCounter()` function, which increments `count` by 1 and updates the HTML display.

```html
<h2>Counter: <span id="counter">0</span></h2>
<button onclick="incrementCounter()">Click Me!</button>
<script>
    let count = 0;
    function incrementCounter() {
        count += 1;
        document.getElementById("counter").innerText = count;
    }
</script>
```
